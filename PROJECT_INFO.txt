Project: MERN Job Portal (Full Stack Test)

Short Description:
A MERN-stack job portal with role-based authentication for Recruiters and Job Seekers. Recruiters can post/manage jobs; job seekers can create profiles and upload resumes. Backend is Node/Express with MongoDB; frontend is React + Redux Toolkit.

Repo layout (important folders/files):
- server/: Express backend
  - server.js: main server entry (mounts routes and Swagger UI at /api-docs)
  - routes/: route definitions (JobRoutes.js, authRoutes.js, applicationRoutes.js, adminRoutes.js)
  - controllers/: controllers implementing route logic
  - models/: Mongoose models (User, Jobs, Application)
  - middleware/: authentication, file upload and authorization middlewares
  - uploads/: static uploads folder (profiles, resumes)
  - swagger.js: Swagger JSDoc config (OpenAPI 3) generated for API docs
  - package.json: server dependencies and scripts
- client/: React frontend
  - src/: React components, pages, redux slices, services
  - package.json: client dependencies and scripts
- README.md: existing project README with setup and screenshots

Tech stack:
- Frontend: React, Redux Toolkit, Vite, React Router
- Backend: Node.js, Express, MongoDB (Mongoose)
- Auth: JWT, bcrypt
- File uploads: Multer + Cloudinary
- API docs: swagger-jsdoc + swagger-ui-express (mounted at /api-docs)

Environment variables (for server/.env):
- PORT (default 5000)
- MONGO_URL (MongoDB connection string)
- JWT_SECRET
- JWT_EXPIRES_IN
- CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME
- CLOUDINARY_API_KEY
- CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET

How to run (local dev):
1) Backend
   cd server
   npm install
   Create .env with the variables above
   npm run dev
   Server available at http://localhost:5000
   Swagger UI: http://localhost:5000/api-docs

2) Frontend
   cd client
   npm install
   npm run dev
   Frontend available at http://localhost:5173 (or as indicated by Vite)

- Jobs: /api/jobs
  - GET /api/jobs/all
  - POST /api/jobs
  - PUT /api/jobs/edit/:jobId
  - GET /api/jobs/edit/:jobId
  - DELETE /api/jobs/delete/:jobId

- Admin (admin-protected): /api/admin
  - Admin routes for user/job/application management

Notes & next steps:
- The project now includes Swagger/OpenAPI JSDoc comments for routes; check /api-docs after installing server deps.
- Consider adding `components.schemas` to the Swagger config for richer model definitions.
- For production, set the Swagger server URL from an env variable and secure access to /api-docs if needed.
