## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

-   Node.js (v18 or later recommended)
-   npm or yarn
-   MongoDB (local instance or a cloud service like MongoDB Atlas)
-   A Cloudinary account for file uploads

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
    cd your-repo-name
    ```

2.  **Backend Setup:**
    ```bash
    # Navigate to the server directory
    cd server

    # Install dependencies
    npm install

    # Create a .env file in the /server directory and add the following variables:
    PORT=5000
    MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
    JWT_SECRET=your_super_secret_jwt_key
    JWT_EXPIRES_IN=7d
    CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloudinary_cloud_name
    CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_cloudinary_api_key
    CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_cloudinary_api_secret

    # Start the backend server
    npm run dev
    ```
    The server will be running on `http://localhost:5000`.

3.  **Frontend Setup:**
    ```bash
    # Navigate to the client directory from the root
    cd ../client

    # Install dependencies
    npm install

    # Start the React development server
    npm start
    ```
    The frontend will open and run on `http://localhost:5173` (or another port if 3000 is busy).
